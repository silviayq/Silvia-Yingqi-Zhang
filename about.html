        <p>Yingqi Zhang (Silvia)<p>

        </p>
            Design and Technology Major, Parsons School of Design
            New York, NY</p>

    
        <p>As a sophomore at Parsons School of Design majoring in <strong>Design and Technology</strong>, my artistic journey has been a continuous exploration of emotion, identity, and cultural narratives. Growing up in <strong>Shanghai, China</strong>, I have always been a deeply sensitive individual, naturally attuned to the subtle emotional landscapes that shape both personal experiences and broader societal structures. This introspective nature has become the foundation of my creative practice, leading me to question how emotion, memory, and culture intertwine in the digital age.</p>
        
        <p>My work traverses diverse mediums — from 3D animation and interactive games to mixed-media installations — but is unified by a core desire: to <strong>visualize the invisible</strong> — feelings, thoughts, and cultural undercurrents that often go unnoticed.</p>

        <p>My first project, <strong>Cycle</strong>, is a meditative exploration of Buddhist philosophy, specifically the concept of <em>chéng zhù huài kōng</em> (formation, existence, disintegration, and emptiness). Through a looping digital environment, I visualized the cyclical nature of life and the transient moments that define human existence, inviting viewers to contemplate their own place within this eternal flow.</p>

        <p>In contrast, <strong>Viscous</strong> delves into the intimate relationship between <strong>emotion and color</strong>. Inspired by my curiosity about how color can act as a vessel for complex emotional states, I crafted a <strong>digital poetry piece</strong> that captures the shifting textures of memory — moments that blur, harden, or dissolve over time. This project reflects my interest in the abstract and the emotional, pushing the boundaries of how intangible feelings can be made tangible through visual art.</p>

        <p>With <strong>Echoes of Choices</strong>, I ventured into <strong>game design</strong> to examine contemporary subcultures in Japanese society, particularly the phenomenon of the <strong>“Land Mine Woman” (<em>Jirai-onna</em>)</strong>. Through the lens of this hyper-stylized character, I created an interactive narrative where players navigate delicate emotional landscapes, exploring themes of loneliness, performative identity, and the consequences of social isolation. The project merges empathy and critique, using gameplay as a tool for cultural commentary.</p>

        <p>My most personal work, <strong>Hard to Tell</strong>, dives into the complex terrain of <strong>memory, trauma, and emotional fragmentation</strong>. This abstract moving image installation visualizes a deeply significant and painful memory — not through linear storytelling but through the raw visual language of color, texture, and motion. By focusing on the sensations and emotional distortions that accompany trauma, I aimed to create an empathetic space where viewers could confront the dissonance between lived experience and memory.</p>

        <p>Across all my works, I am driven by a desire to <strong>translate internal experiences into visual form</strong>. Whether through digital environments, interactive narratives, or moving images, I strive to create spaces where emotion becomes both palpable and shareable. My work sits at the intersection of <strong>technology, culture, and psychology</strong>, constantly questioning how art can be a conduit for empathy and understanding in an increasingly digitized world.</p>

        <p>As I continue my artistic journey, I am committed to deepening my exploration of personal and collective narratives, using technology not just as a tool, but as a <strong>language for human connection</strong>.</p>
